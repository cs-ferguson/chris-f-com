  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>As a Product Manager and Delivery specialist I've been bringing advanced technology products and services from ideation to launch for over 8 years now - identifying and solidifying goals, building teams and communicating ideas.</p>
  <p>As a generalist and renowned problem-solver I have a wide-ranging background that includes an Architecture degree, project manager for engineering fabrications, some graphic design and illustration work, a stint as a postman, and (what I like to think of as) a semi-professional track and field career (I earned Â£50 in prize money).</p>
