Short week last week due to two days off, so combining week 50 and 51.

## What did I learn this week?

I was excited to be able to try out [Notion's new AI](https://www.notion.so/product/ai) authoring features, and tried it to generate some content for a blog post I'm planning on fiber optic sensing. The results were interesting - there's a bit of a dearth of info on FO sensing aorund the net, and this obviously caused problems. For topics that are well documented online however, it looks to be an awesome tool.

## What do I need to take care of?

Getting things finished. Getting together with the Product team to organise and prioritise our work.

## Selfâ€¦

I'm up to 150kg x 3 x 3 on the high box-squats. Really enjoying them - getting absolutely zero post-session soreness due to the tiny range of motion and can feel the power coming back into my hips. Another 60m race on the cards in January.

## Tweet of the week

Is it really viable though? :)

(I feel as though most of my "tweets of the week" will be either Allen Holub or Jason Knight)
