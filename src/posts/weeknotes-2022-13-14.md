Week 13 was a whirlwind. The first half of the week was spent laying concrete floor leveller, tiling and general DIY. Much tacit knowledge was gained, but not deeply enough absorbed to make it explicit at this stage - sorry Nonaka and Takeuchi.

The end of the week consisted of travelling to Hampshire to meet my new teammates at Fotech. I had a good time, and feel lucky to have had the opportunity to meet everyone in the flesh before I started and retreated to a fully remote world. Experienced the eternal nightmare of lateral-thinking, team-building exercises - I was very conscious not to be too quiet during the exercises.

Week 14 saw my official start. My general uneasiness with not knowing everything is surfacing and I have to explicitly tell myself I just need to learn enough to do a good job. Neuroses aside I am throwing myself into the the Security world and trying to learn everything I can.

As part of this, my second day in the job sees my driving down to Birmingham for my first ever visit to the NEC.

## Achievements

- I introduced myself to, and met a lot of new people
- I successfully navigated a networking event solo without looking like too much of a weirdo

## Things that I learned this week...

- I had a crash course in the technical aspects of the optics side of Distributed Acoustic Sensing. I have a lot of work to do to improve my understanding
- I also learned a lot about our product offerings

## Targets for next week

- Go into every meeting I have with lots of questions
- Get to grips with our marketing collateral
