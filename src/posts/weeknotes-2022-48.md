## This week

- I learned the difference between WDM and TDM - always incremementally improving my technical knowledge: this week - optics.
- Achievements: Received positive feedback for some market analysis that I presented to partners. As I'm still developing and lacking a bit of confidence in that area, I was happy to receive some affirmation!

### What do I need to take care of?

Following on from [this thought](https://twitter.com/profgalloway/status/1598374115961966592?s=20&t=J2DlwgwpSnWSKdzvJ6q6Sg) I want get some momentum built for 2023. I need to get the details behind our Product goals clearly documented to communicate to the rest of the company, and to support the processes of other teams. If I can get this collated for the end of the year it will allows us to start 2023 well.

I also need to improve my interaction with our Sales team - what info do I hold that would be useful to them and help them succeed?

## Self

- FOOD: Do Chorizo and Bean stew in a skillet - makes for best consistency and texture - allows you to make egg wells - means you can actually bake the beans.
- FITNESS: High-box squats (3 x 5 x 140kg) - turns out I can move heavy stuff with a *very* limited range of motion. Got massive DOMS from them, but still managed 10 x 100m on Sunday (approx. 85%).
