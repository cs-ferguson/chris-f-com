Wow. One of those weeks that disappears in the blink of an eye. Short weeknotes this time.

At work, it was a case of annual reviews, and handovers:

This week it became common knowledge at Big Bite that I’m leaving. As a result I received some lovely feedback. 

Attention now increasingly turns to my new Product Owner role. I’m frantically filling in certain gaps in my knowledge such as commercial-related issues, how to run a business, and (to a lesser extent) the science of fibre-optics.

## Questions

- Is this the windiest Winter on record in the UK? Eunice must be the 5th or 6th storm now where winds have reached Gale force since September. We've had 3 in one week! I often feel this is how Climate Change will hit Britain the hardest. Nice and temperate, with the odd flood, but constant brutal winds knacking everything.

## What I’ve learned

- You can still fiddle about with a WordPress theme’s CSS within the editor - the `wp-admin/customize.php` page is still there - you just have to visit it directly.
- In Japan a lot of the nuclear power plants were shut down and never started up again after Fukushima due to resistance form the public. As a result they’re turning to coal, and trying to greenwash it with some proposed carbon-capture and storage projects. An economy like that with minimal nuclear has got to be pumping out a lot of CO2 yet you don’t hear about it?
