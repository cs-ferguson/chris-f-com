## What did I learn this week?

This week I learned that Nike owns Converse. Not life-changing, but always interesting finding more out about the tangled web of the commercial world. 

## What was challenging?

I held a project kick-off this week for the first time in 2 years. It was challenging co-ordinating so many different disciplines - coming from software/web, everyone spoke almost the same language. On reflection though, it was like putting on a comfortable pair of old slippers. My slippers though. Someone else's old slippers would not be a comfortable experience. 

## What do I need to take care of?

Next up it's getting back to Epic and Story-writing - my first chance real chance to do so as a Product Manager, and my first chance to put into practice a lot of things that I learned on my last project that I never got a chance to try (focus on the "why" to let the smart people work it out, less obsessing about backlog structure and format). 

## Self...

The coffee shop didn't give me decaf for my second coffee - the resulting buzz sent my resting heart rate soaring to 57bpm.
