With things winding down in my current job I don’t have much to offer this week in terms of achievements, or work-based learnings. I’ll keep it brief so I don’t have a lapsed week so early into my Weeknotes routine!

## What I’ve learned

- The meaning of amortisation. I really need to brush up on my business finance.
- The origin of the term “laying the table” from [this article](https://www.archdaily.com/977914/setting-the-table-from-the-ordinary-table-to-the-extraordinary-table?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=webfeeds). Which has led me to one of my questions for the week. This led me to the observation that you don’t see temporary tables very often, even in relatively small spaces. Only micro-homes.
