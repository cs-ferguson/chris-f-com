I've been quiet again, but I have a good excuse this time. I just can't tell you what it is.

## What did I learn this week?

Finance stuff: What *goodwill* is in company accounts, and when it is actually recorded. That *amortisation* is basically the same as *depreciation* but for intangibles.

I also learned the term "escaped defects" - a lovely way of describing those defects that make it into the users' hands.

## What was challenging?

I'm looking for work, and it's always challenging going through that part when you work out how to describe yourself and your experiences. It is nice that every interview and cover letter is a way of testing what works and doesn't work - whether you hear back or not is a good metric to judge success by, and it's refreshing to be able to iterate so fast after working on a complex hardware product with slow feedback cycles for the past year!

## What do I need to take care of?

After a period of turbulence, I need to get back to writing as a way of gathering my thoughts. I also need to start upping my note-taking game again in meetings.
