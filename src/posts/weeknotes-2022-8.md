## Achievements

I’m pretty happy with how my handover of QA has gone at Big Bite - I think the process benefited from clarity of presentation of what we have achieved to date, but more importantly clarity on expected next steps and a clear pathway for progression, complete with what would evidence success.

## Thoughts

> If your processes are tight, then you should be able to gauge progress asynchronously by looking at your PM software...

I randomly had the chance to collate my thoughts and observations on different styles of “stand-ups/catch-ups” as part of a discussion. I thought I’d include them here:

- *Showcase style* catch-ups (user demos what they have been working on) are good for disseminating information but they are lengthy (avg. 5-10 mins. per attendee). I have deployed these when working with new starters to the company when they tackle individual projects. There’s no time pressure so they’re fine and are good for increasing understanding as well.
- *Progress style* stand-ups - like the most common 3 question stand-up are good for keeping people informed, but it can be hard to maintain discipline in them, and people often turn up unprepared and waste their time, or spend too long on one part. In reflection, I wish I had never used these. If your processes are tight, then you should be able to gauge progress asynchronously by looking at your PM software, or if it requires it pop a message in Slack.
- I have had success recently with *one-question* stand-ups. The question is “What is blocking you from achieving your current task/goal?”. I have found it is easier to maintain discipline, and that people who turn up unprepared are still able to answer this question, although sometimes it takes some prompting as it can be hard to realise what is actually causing you issues.

## What I’ve learned this week

> Using Loopback to add some light background Muzak always helps.

- I experimented with Loom, then went down a rabbit-hole and ended up learning how to use OBS. If I’m going to be a Product Manager I need to know how to create engaging demos!! Using Loopback to add some light background Muzak always helps.
- Interesting Arch Daily article on Japanese architecture offices that basically open on to the street like shop fronts. I wonder if this is practical?
- I (re)learned the origins of the term soap opera from this amusing excerpt from the Company:
