After a measly 6 months I have returned to Weeknotes. 

They fell by the wayside last time as I was spending too much time thinking about their content, whilst simultaneously trying to learn an entriely new discipline - cognitively, all a bit much. After being contacted by someone I had inspired to start weeknote-ing I felt as though I owed it to them to start again!

## This week

- I pivoted massively in my strategic approach to lead-gen. I felt bad on the team performing the research for my Tory-style flip-flop; but it was done based on evidence and solid reasoning - that makes me feel better about it.
- I made a mistake when categorising a project, and probably made someone's life harder as a result. Time to own that mistake.
- I took the lead on defining some process and the interface between Product and Engineering - it was like slipping into an old, comfortable pair of shoes!
- It is clear from a few discussions at work that my communication of Product direction has not been as clear as it could have been. This must improve. Improvement would be evidenced by colleagues through all departments knowing what we are aiming to achieve within the Security market.


## Self

This time around, I'm going to use them as a bit of an exercise/mental and physical fitness diary as well. I've started exercising fairly regularly again, trying out a few new methods to try and maintain my joint health, so it'll be nice to have a record of progress.

- I **finally** took the time to learn how to do PAILs and RAILs properly with the help of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXFtN_mFuW4&ab_channel=PippinPerformance). Since then I have implemented them on a few positions foucssed on my problematic hips. Two sessions in and initial results have been positive...
- ...as I competed a heavy sled push and plyo session (6x 140/160kg over 20m followed by sets of hops x6/broad jumps x6) with minimal hip pain in the following days.
- ...tightness in hamstrings on Friday following Wednesday session however. Whether this was sldes, plyos, or hamstring exercises unknown.
- Pull-up strength **slowly** returning - unable to complete rep 30 in (5 sets of 6)
