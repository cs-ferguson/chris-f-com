!["A person holding a list of requirements so long that it trails along the floor."](https://cfergo.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/requirements.jpeg)

Sometimes you receive a set of requirements with line items in there that are just obviously never going to be built (something even more obvious after you get wind of the budget). There will often be one or two lines in there where the costs so massively outweigh the benefits that there seems no reason to put them in there. So when you're putting together your next RFQ, before you go adding a requirement for that all-singing-all-dancing .xlsx upload parser, or that integrated, automated translation tool that doesn't require any proof reading; consider if you really need it in the _initial_ version of your product.

These kinds of requirements get sent out for a lot of reasons; appeasement or power relations are a couple of good ones, but often it is the amount of time required to sit down with your team and go through all of the requirements you've gathered from your stakeholders and start trimming them. 

## What is the problem?

If you don't cut or filter these kinds of items out of your requirements list every agency/vendor you send them out to will just have to do that for you, and I can tell you now; they don't like doing it. Why? Because that involves spending unpaid time and resource (usually quite a lot of time and resource) working out how they would build things so they can estimate these complex items. The frustration is compounded as more often than not, when the real cost of these items become clear they are instantly cut from the project.

## Practical Approaches

Something that could be beneficial to everyone, is to do a bit of research into your more complex requirements to check if there are any precedents out there. If you are unable to find an example of the same thing being built (or something very similar, and I mean 95% the same) then it is highly likely you are breaking new ground with your project. If you find these kinds of requirements this becomes the point where you decide what kind of project you want:

1. Straight-forward / Business-as-usual / Simple
2. Exploratory / Research-driven / Complex

If you want something estimated accurately, built quickly, and with minimal risk of encountering issues and unknowns, you're looking for approach number one. As a result, you should cut out any requirements where you are unable to offer a precedent as you are unlikely have the time or budget to develop the solutions. If a requirement is something that a vendor (or anyone) has not built before it is impossible to estimate accurately, and the approach to the project would need to be number 2: exploratory, and iterative.

_Sidenote_: Beware any vendor who tells you they can estimate something they have never built before.

This does not mean you have to throw those requirements in the bin, but you should treat them differently and separate them from your main requirements. Present them to vendors as something you are exploring but are unsure if you have budget for them as you do not have any indication of the effort involved in building them. This clarity will benefit relationships; you may find vendors respond more positively to helping find a solution than if you bury them in a lengthy list of requirements.

If you perform this analysis and it turns out your highest priority requirements have no precedent, and the project does not exist without them, then you need to re-assess what kind of project you are running and subsequently _what kind of relationship you want with a vendor..._

## Doctors and Waiters

One of my favourite analogies is the Doctor vs Waiter analogy that I heard via [Jeff Gothelf on the Digital PM podcast](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8xMDk3MzAucnNz/episode/QnV6enNwcm91dC01MjM3NjIz?ep=14) (I think he credits Jeff Patton with it). When you send out a brief are you looking for a Doctor or a Waiter? You would go to a Doctor with your symptoms - the problems you are facing - and expect solutions, or a proposed course of action to treat them. Put short; you trust the Doctor's knowledge/experience (expertise) over your own. In a restaurant you tell a waiter exactly what you want - you don't just tell them you're hungry (the problem) and expect them to come back with something satisfactory. Not that that's impossible, **but it's much less likely**.

Try to work out which relationship you want with your vendor before you send out your brief: If you are looking for a Doctor (someone whose expertise you trust) to deliver your project try to avoid a brief with hugely detailed requirements - instead focus on symptoms and problems. If you are looking for a Waiter, the onus is on you to ensure your requirements are already trimmed down to exactly what you want (and ideally sufficiently detailed). You don't give the waiter a huge list of meals and expect them to spend 30 minutes working out which ones you actually want while the rest of the restaurant gives you dirty looks.

_Sidenote_: That analogy never gets old.

## Benefits

If you can make sure your requirements are as lean and mean as possible before you send them out there are two main fronts you will benefit on:
1. Improved undertsanding of your own project across your team
2. Faster, clearer and more accurate (and more positive) responses

### Improved understanding

To whittle down your requirements, you will need to spend time with all of your stakeholders truthfully analysing the priorities of your project. In doing so the shared understanding across the team will increase, and at some point you will have to confront the driving forces and goals of your project. You may uncover some important truths whilst doing so.

### Improved responses

If there are less requirements to sift through, you will likely get a response from potential vendors at a faster rate, and you will probably get more responses. Also, as previously mentioned, doing the work of filtering out those complex, ground-breaking features will save the vendor work and time, and save you having lots of clarification questions. The major benefit however, is that you are more likely to be able to compare apples with apples when comparing quotes. If an Agency does its own filtering exercise on requirements to make a project more manageable or achievable, it is unlikely you will receive two quotes the same - more often than not they will be quotes for entirely different scopes of work.

## Summary

- Time-permitting, sit down with your stakeholders and prioritise requirements prior to sending out RFQs: This not only makes it easier to trim things once budget-realities become clear, but will help everyone improve their understanding of the project.
- Check if there is precedent for all of the features in your list of requirements.
- Confirm what kind of project you want (and have the budget for) - Straight-forward or exploratory?
- Confirm what kind of relationship you want with a vendor: Doctor vs. Waiter (trusting vs. transactional)
- Succeed!
