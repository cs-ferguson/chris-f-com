!["A person holding a list of requirements so long that it trails along the floor."](https://cfergo.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/requirements.jpeg)

When you work in an agency sometimes you receive a set of requirements with line items in there that are just obviously never going to be built (something even more obvious after you get wind of the budget). There will often be one or two lines in there where the costs so massively outweigh the benefits that there seems no reason to put them in there. So when you're putting together your next RFQ, before you go adding a requirement for that all-singing-all-dancing .xlsx upload parser, or that integrated, automated translation tool that doesn't require any proof reading; consider if you really need it in the _initial_ version of your product.

These kinds of requirements get sent out for a lot of reasons; appeasement or power relations are a couple of good ones, but often it is the amount of time required to sit down with your team and go through all of the requirements you've gathered from your stakeholders and start trimming them. 

## What is the problem?

Time and money - free work

Only for 99% of the time for these ot be instantly cut when the real cost becomes clear

You can mitigate this by separating out requirements where you are unsure if there is any precedent...

But if you don't cut these items out of your requirements list every agency/vendor you send them out to will just have to do that for you, and I can tell you now; they don't like doing it. Why? Because that involves _spending unpaid time and resource_ (usually quite a lot of time and resource) working out how they would build things so they can estimate these complex items.

genuinely just want a technical expert to confirm your suspicions and that's fine, but it would be helpful to be clear in your brief that you are looking for advice on those particular requirements. Which brings me to the point that when you are hunting for your vendor - be clear on if you are dictating requirements, or if you're looking for a Doctor...

## First, work out what type of relationship you want

One of my favourite analogies is the Doctor vs Waiter analogy that I heard via [Jeff Gothelf on the Digital PM podcast](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8xMDk3MzAucnNz/episode/QnV6enNwcm91dC01MjM3NjIz?ep=14) (I think he credits Jeff Patton with it). When you send out a brief are you looking for a Doctor or a Waiter? You would go to a Doctor with your symptoms - the problems you are facing - and expect solutions, or a proposed course of action to treat them. Put short; you trust the Doctor's knowledge/experience (expertise) over your own. In a restaurant you tell a waiter exactly what you want - you don't just tell them you're hungry (the problem) and expect them to come back with something satisfactory. Not that that's impossible, **but it's much less likely**.

Try to work out which relationship you want with your vendor before you send out your brief: If you are looking for a Doctor (someone whose expertise you trust) to deliver your project try to avoid a brief with hugely detailed requirements - instead focus on symptoms and problems. If you are looking for a Waiter, the onus is on you to ensure your requirements are already trimmed down to exactly what you want (and ideally sufficiently detailed). You don't give the waiter a huge list of meals and expect them to spend 30 minutes working out which ones you actually want while the rest of the restaurant gives you dirty looks.

_Note_: That analogy never gets old.

## Benefits

If you can make sure your requirements are as lean and mean as possible before you send them out there are two main fronts you will benefit on:
1. Improved undertsanding of your own project across your team
2. Faster, clearer and more accurate responses

### Improved understanding

To whittle down your requirements, you will need to spend time with all of your stakeholders truthfully analysing the priorities of your project. In doing so the shared understanding across the team will increase, and at some point you will have to confront the driving forces and goals of your project. You may uncover some important truths whilst doing so.

### Improved responses

If there are less requirements to sift through, you will likely get a response from potential vendors at a faster rate, and you will probably get more responses. The major benefit however, is that you are more likely to be able to compare apples with apples when comparing quotes. If an Agency does its own filtering exercise on requirements to make a project more manageable or achievable, it is unlikely you will receive two quotes the same - more often than not they will be quotes for entirely different scopes of work.
