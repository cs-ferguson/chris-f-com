- Week 1 of trying to “Work in the open” a bit more. I found out that spending the time to produce an asynchronous update can be beneficial - although asynchronous questions generated more interaction than just awareness raising posts (e.g. what I’m working on). Allowing people to come to an issue when they have time, and particualrly for technical issues - giving them time to look up and formulate an answer - leads to an increase in the value of responses.
- Despite being quite simple, I’ve decided to view the way we build sites with central components as a service, to see what insights this brings. I’m hoping my Questionnaire delivers some insights from the team.
- I do need to practice producing questionnaires - I'm struggling with clarity.
- WordPress has taken another step forwards by adding an example of limiting block functionality by user role to core. Something that has been missing for a while but will be incredibly useful going forwards.
- I found out that it *is* possible to join a meeting from Costa Coffee, and that one of the team working in their Hartlepool Middleton Grange branch is quite a character - I enjoyed his enthusiasm - it seemed to spread to the rest of the team.
- For some reason the quality of my audio and video on calls has suddenly become of concern to me so I’ve decided to treat myself to an external mic and external camera as a reward for a difficult weekend of child-rearing (I don’t look hard for excuses).
- I've started going to the Gym after a pandemic of distance running. Despite the lack of daylight (such a dim place for having such yellow walls) and fresh air in there, it was nice to be using my muscles a bit more and bouncing over things again. Also started doing my sprinting drills - I wonder what the people on the sit-down bikes think as I go awkwardly skipping past them. One of the coaches on Insta was saying the movements need to be smooth "like a dance". Something for me to work on.
