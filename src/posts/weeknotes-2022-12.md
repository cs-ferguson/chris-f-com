Getting ready to switch from delivery to product, this week by looking into go-to-market strategies. Looking forward to developing one of these in practice now.

I said goodbye to the legendary Big Bite team with a good send off including a Pie Jackers lunch and a few drinks. Now for a few days of intense DIY before meeting the new team.

Back to that awkward phase of working out who everyone is, what they do, make a good impression and trying not to second guess all of my communications. I thought it would get easier with age but apparently not!

The sheer amount of tiling I have to do in the next few days should take my mind off any nerves anyway.

This week I also learned what an embarrassingly parallel problem is - something new for the knowledge bank.
