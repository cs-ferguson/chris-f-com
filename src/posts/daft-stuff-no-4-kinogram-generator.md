At the end of last year, I started coaching sprints. Or, I should say, I started coaching other people and not just myself.

One of my favourite methods of analysis for a sprinter is the Kinogram method popularised by Altis. You can read more about it here, but essentially you record a sprinter during a run, and perform an analysis by viewing stills of 5 key points within their stride. 

This can be done easily by frame-by-framing through a video, but to make this a valuable artefact tos hare, it is useful to compile the screenshots into a single image so each phase of the stride, on each leg, can be quickly cross-referenced.

In the past, when I have just been analysing myself, it was perfectly feasible to resize, crop and compile the screenshots manually within an image editor. Now that I have 10+ athletes to do it for, it becomes less feasible.

Luckily, I'm a resourceful chap, so I've come up with the following workflow:

## Step 1: Take the screengrabs and save them to a directory

## Step 2: Run my Kinogram generator script on the screengrabs

## Step 3: That's it! Enjoy your Kinograms
