Improving discovery and direct contact with customers is something that has been on my mind recently. These 3 things were implemented by [Maxdome](https://jeffgothelf.com/blog/okr-leadership-without-product-discovery-your-teams-are-just-guessing/):

1. Unlimited customer research budget
2. Mandatory monthly hours in the call center call
3. Face to face sales of the service

All are quite reproducable across a variety of types of product, although I’d be very interested to see how much they ended up spending on research!

## What I’ve Learned this week

### District Heating

I encountered an [article from Kevin McCloud](https://group.vattenfall.com/uk/newsroom/News/2022/why-district-heating-is-good-news-for-all-of-us) promoting District Heating schemes. I had no idea that Iceland shared its heat as a utility, and the concept never even occurred to me before. Interesting to see schemes already underway in the UK. The big question for me now is if it is feasible to implement anywhere other than new build estates?

## What did I struggle with?

### Business Model Canvasses are tricky

I’ve been having my first goes at creating a Business Model Canvas with real-world applications. Things I found difficult included getting things in the right categories, and keeping the whole thing focussed. It was too tempting to fill up the sections with post-its - there is little room for nuance in the canvas, and I suppose that is part of the point - it simplifies the vision to make it easier to communicate and share.
