## What did I learn this week?

I've been reading [Continuous Discovery Habits](https://www.producttalk.org/2021/05/continuous-discovery-habits/) by Teresa Torres. It's full of incredibly practical advice and backed up by good examples - I really like her writing style and structure. I've already absorbed a lot of the advice into my Product Management philosophy (see "what went well").

I also enjoyed [this article](https://medium.com/@dakic/multi-layer-product-roadmap-64b4fd5004b4) on roadmaps that was, again, helpfully practical!

## What went well?

The past few weeks have been a great chance to clarify my thinking on how I manage products. This week I collated and translated my thoughts and ideal process into a Miro board to represent it visually - I'm really pleased I did it as (with a bit of tidying up) I can carry it forward, iterate on it, and use it to present my thinking.

## What do I need to take care of?

Next up - do the same visual thought/philosophy map but adapted for project delivery.

## Selfâ€¦

I successfully completed a glute-ham raise (a set of 8 actually). Possibly my first ever one? I can't remember. It's a sign that working on the strength of the non-Hollywood muscles (hip flexors, adductors, hamstrings) is paying off.
