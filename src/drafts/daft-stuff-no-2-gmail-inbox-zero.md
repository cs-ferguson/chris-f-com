Google has killed a lot of things in its time:

Google+

Google Wave (which Microsoft seem to have rebuilt)

Jeeves from Ask Jeeves

Privacy

But the only one I really miss is Google Inbox

ABOUT GOOGLE INBOX

One of my favourite things, was you got a nice picture of a sun when you hit Inbox Zero

Inbox Zero for you workflow plebs is when you clear your Inbox (usually achieved by snoozing or deleting all of your emails)

What is baffling, is that this feature made it into GMail's mobile app, but never to it's desktop web app

So I built a Chrome Extension that does it for me...

There is nothing to learn from this. It doesn't really improve my workflow at all.

It's just daft.
